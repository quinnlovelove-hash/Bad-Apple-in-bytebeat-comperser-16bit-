##🌌 Bad Apple!! Ultra High-Res Bytebeat (96kHz / 24-bit)

Pushing the boundaries of Browser-based audio synthesis. This project transforms the legendary "Bad Apple!!" into a massive Hexadecimal data stream for real-time playback at 96,000Hz using the Bytebeat esoteric language.

## 🚀 How to Use (with Zopium)

1. **Generate the Data**:
   * Run the provided Python script `encoder.py` to generate the audio data file.
   * Open the output file with **EmEditor** (Standard Notepad is not recommended due to file size).
2. **Setup Player**:
   * Go to [zopium.neocities.org](https://zopium.neocities.org/).
   * Click **Stop** before pasting to ensure stability.
   * Paste the entire generated code into the editor.
3. **Audio Configuration**:
   * Change the **Sample Rate** to **96000**.
   * Ensure the mode is set to **Floatbeat**.
   * Press **Play** (If no sound, press Reset t=0).

## 🛠️ Prerequisites & Installation

To run the encoder script, you need **Python 3.8+** and the following libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy librosa soundfile
